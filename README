Project short description:

phpmywhs is an open source warehouse management software.
This software is far away to be mature, the development process has been just
started, phpmywhs needs a lot of "care" before being ready to production
environments.


Branch Unstable Information:

This is the unstable branch and it is the main development branch.
The code in this branch (unstable) will CHANGE without any advice and for
any reason, like:
1) New ideas.
2) Adding new functionality.
3) Refactoring.
4) Bugfixes.
This branch is for ONLY experimental code and development, the code in this
branch (unstable) could change often and a lot so, it should be better to not
use this branch in production environments unless if you are not very aware of
what you are doing.
