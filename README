Project short description:

Abandoned project.
THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO BE DELETED on 2017-11-05. CLONE OR FORK BEFORE THAT DATE!!!

phpmywhs is an open source warehouse management software.
This software is far away to be mature, the development process has been just
started, phpmywhs needs a lot of "care" before being ready to production
environments.


Branches:

master - general infos.
stable - stable releases.
testing - releases under testing.
unstable - development releases (absolutely not suitable for production
environments).
