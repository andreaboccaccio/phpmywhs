Project short description:

phpmywhs is an open source warehouse management software.
This software is far away to be mature, the development process has been just
started, phpwms needs a lot of "care" before being ready to production
environments.


Branch Stable Information:

This is the stable branch and it is the branch of the already tested and
stable software.
The only development that is possible in this branch is related ONLY to
apply bugfixes.
The code in this branch (stable) will NOT change to add new functionality
or to refactoring the code.
This branch is for ONLY already DEEPLY and HEAVILY tested software and if
some of the software is here it is very likely it will NOT change often,
otherwise it means that software is in the wrong branch (that is:
it was merged in stable branch too soon from testing branch).
