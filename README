This software is far away to be mature, the development process has been just
started, phpmywhs needs a lot of "care" before being ready to production
environments.


Branches:

master - general infos.
stable - stable releases.
testing - releases under testing.
unstable - development releases (absolutely not suitable for production
environments).
