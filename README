Project short description:

phpmywhs is an open source warehouse management software.
This software is far away to be mature, the development process has been just
started, phpmywms needs a lot of "care" before being ready to production
environments.


Branch Testing Information:

This is the testing branch and it is the branch for the code that has reached
the functional maturity, but it needs more deep and heavy testing before to
move on toward stable branch.
The code in this branch will NOT change to add functionality but it could
change ONLY to refactor it or to apply bugfixes.
This branch is for testing code, the code in this branch (testing) could change
often and a lot, and above all it is NOT deeply and heavily tested, but its
functionality is locked down, so even if it is not higly suggested to use it in
production environment, you know that its interface and functionality will be
ever the same, then its usage in testing environments is very encouraged and
about production environment its usage is feasible.
